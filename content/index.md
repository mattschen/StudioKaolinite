title: Welcome to my digital studio

Welcome! This is where you can find any of my recipes, processes, or anything else I'm testing out or working on. If you have access to it, this is also where you can find my seconds and tests.

If you have any questions about what you see here, feel free to DM me at [@studio.kaolinite](https://www.instagram.com/studio.kaolinite/) or shoot me an email at studio.kaolinite@gmail.com. Otherwise you can find me at various markets happening in NYC. My next market will be at [Artmageddon](https://www.beautifybrooklyn.org) in Flatbush with my studio, Flatbush Clayworks.
